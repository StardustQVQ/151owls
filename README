===WELCOME TO CS151 OWLS===

This repository contains all exercises done in each OWLS session, organized by week. It will also have PDFs of exercises and practice exams. You can email me (Rob) or Emily if you have any trouble getting the materials you need.

Files will be uploaded on weekly basis, likely after the session occurs (if you want to get them as soon as possible, show up to OWLS!)
