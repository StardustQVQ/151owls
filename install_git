If you dont have it already, just go to Terminal and type "git" and click enter.

Windows

Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win The download should start on its own. This isn't actually Git, its called Git for Windows. You can find out more GFW at gitforwindows.org. 

Reach out to Emily or I if you have other issues.
